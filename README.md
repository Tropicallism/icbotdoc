# Imperial Creed Automation System

Roblox to Discord integration program! Created by Tropical#4164.

Hello everyone, this is the new bot of Imperial Creed, ICAS. To start,

If you've invited the bot already, (Which you can't and somehow you do? WHAT?). Make sure the roles you DON'T want to have admin commands, uncheck "Adminstrator". This bot checks if you have that perm. If you do, it allows you. One way to bypass this clearly, have a role with the admin perm checked. Then with the authorized personnel give that role.

Right, so where are the commands? If you do ;Help, it'll bring you here. Right so, uh... Commands... Their not avalible to the public if you're not an authorized personnel. If you ARE an authorized personnel, please check #ICAS_ADMIN_COMMANDS on the discord. Not there? Ask Tropical#4164.

Public Commands:

;Users | This will tell you how many users are in the Discord, note, this does not keep out bots.

;RBXCheck | This will tell you the person's rank in the group.

;Ping | This is mainly used for the latency test of the bot. Which should be really low.

You might say, that's not much. Yeah. I know. This bot is supposed to be used for Hi-Com and High Rank members only. May or may not, when I complete the department of the authorized personnel's commands. I may add some fun stuff for the public. As for now, use the other bots.
